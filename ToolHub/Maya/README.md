# mayaModules

This is the package using for maya only.

userLibrary is the place you can save out your work as personal assets could be used in any project. It has 4 types which will be automatically read data individually: Camera, Controller, Modeling, Lighting.

When you open Maya via tools manager, Maya will automatically load a menu name "Pipeline Menu" in main Layout, also, it loads a pipeline dock which has every tools that I built in it.

Take a look and feedback always welcomes.
