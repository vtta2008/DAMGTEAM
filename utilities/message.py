PIPELINE TOOL TO MAKE A SHORT FILM

This application is built to handle and manage productions as a pipeline tool.
Currently, it is working with software package: plt_maya, ZBrush, plt_mari, plt_nuke with V-ray plugin.

The largest version of Python is Python 3.5, however Python 3.x has introduced many breaking changes to Python. 
These changes are for the better but due to large investment into Python 2 code, plt_maya will continue to be on 
Python 2 for a while longer.

You can see the details off platforms that is agreed by industry: www.vfxplatform.com.

For feedback or questions, feel free to email me: damgteam@gmail.com or dot@damgteam.com
