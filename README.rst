PIPELINE MANAGER
================

This application can be used to build, manage, and optimise vfx pipelines. The current version is compatible with Windows 10.

Due to VFX Reference Platform and the large invention, we need to stay with python 2.7 but expect to migrate to python 3 in 2019 (Delayed to 2020).
See `details <http://www.vfxplatform.com>`_

NOTE:

    - It is still under developing, some function may not be working yet.
    - Really struggling at compling to executable file as well as build the installation.
