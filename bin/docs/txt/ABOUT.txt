    SHORT FILM PIPELINE
    ===================

    This application can be used to build, manage, and optimise film making pipelines. The latest version is compatible
    with Windows 10 and may run on earlier versions. It does not run in Maya 2016 or lower.

    Due to VFX Reference Platform and the large invention, we need to stay with python 2.7 but expect to migrate to python 3 in 2019.
    Details are here: <http://www.vfxplatform.com>
